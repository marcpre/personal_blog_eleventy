# Factors for a high-traffic website

## The business model

Ads are one of the best business models as it can be run entirely passiv. To estimate how many impressions you need you use:

## Revenue Per Thousand Impressions (RPM)
* RPM is the estimated earnings you can expect for every 1,000 impressions. This varies widely based on the niche, geographic location of the audience, and the quality of the content.
* A general RPM range for display ads might be between $1 and $10. However, for highly targeted niches, it can go much higher.

If your niche is gaming and you are using only display ads (e.g., Google AdSense), the RPM is generally in the range of $2 to $5.

So to earn 10k you can estimate how many views you need:

### Low RPM ($2)

**Required Traffic**: 
\[
\frac{10,000}{2} \times 1000 = 5,000,000
\]
monthly impressions.

### Mid RPM ($3)

**Required Traffic**: 
\[
\frac{10,000}{3} \times 1000 = 3,333,333
\]
monthly impressions.

### High RPM ($5)

**Required Traffic**: 
\[
\frac{10,000}{5} \times 1000 = 2,000,000
\]
monthly impressions.
