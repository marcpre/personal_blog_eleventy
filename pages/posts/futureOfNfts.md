# The Future of NFTs

There are some interesting tweets about the future of the NFT market. Many of these posts try to predict, where the NFT market is going.

This post is a collection of these tweets.

In a nutshell, they predict:

1. NFTs are not going to zero
2. We will see crazy price action again, but only for a few projects
3. Being an early project won't help much if team execution is bad
4. New projects have an edge over old ones
5. We'll see a shift towards cheaper NFTs + L2 adoption

I would say that most of these predictions are not completely unsurprising as they describe the general market tenor.
