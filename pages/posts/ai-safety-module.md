# Implementing AI-Safety in a LLM-System Architecture

As advancements in artificial intelligence continue at a breakneck pace, we are witnessing the rise of increasingly sophisticated models, namely Large Language Models (LLMs). The potential applications of these models are vast, particularly in the business sector where they can revolutionize customer service. But with great power comes great responsibility. It's imperative that we understand the risks and integrate safety measures effectively. Let's dive into the world of LLMs, the safety concerns they present, and how businesses can safely harness their capabilities.

## The State of Large Language Models (LLMs)

LLMs, such as GPT-4 by OpenAI, are the latest AI models that generate human-like text. They are trained on a wide variety of internet text and respond to user prompts by predicting what comes next in a given piece of text. Their power lies in their ability to understand context, generate creative and coherent responses, and to some extent, mimic human conversation.

The power of an LLM lies in its experience. An LLM is like your assistant, that is always available and helps you whenever you need something from it.

## The Dangers of Hallucination
One of the critical issues that arise with LLMs is 'hallucination'. This term refers to the model generating information that is not present in the input data or any part of its training data. It's dangerous because it can lead to the dissemination of false or misleading information, which can be particularly problematic in sensitive applications such as healthcare, legal advice, or customer service.

Consider hallucination in this manner: An LLM is designed to assist you constantly. If you pose an unclear question, or if the LLM is unable to provide useful assistance, it may result in the generation of odd or unexpected responses.

Businesses that want to leverage the impressive capabilities of LLMs for customer service should be particularly wary of hallucination. To provide the most accurate information to their customers, businesses must ensure that the AI doesn't generate potentially harmful or inaccurate content.

## Integrating Internal Data into LLMs
Moreover, for a business aiming to employ an LLM for customer service, it's crucial to contemplate the integration of their internal data into the LLMs. One method could involve formulating a prompt based on the customer's query, supplemented by the company's internal data. Therefore, it's essential for the business to discern the customer's question's intent.  Consequently, the LLM can utilize this enriched prompt to produce a response that mimics human conversation.

Adding to the previous point, understanding a customer's intent can be greatly enhanced with the use of machine learning (ML). This can be achieved by training a separate ML model on previous customer interactions, enabling it to identify patterns and commonalities in how customers phrase their questions when they have specific intents.

For example, queries about product pricing might frequently contain words such as 'cost', 'price', 'charge', etc. By recognizing these patterns, the ML model can predict the customer's intent even when the question is phrased differently or is a bit ambiguous.

Once the customer's intent is identified, it can be paired with relevant internal data to create a rich, context-aware prompt for the LLM. This not only helps the LLM generate a more accurate and helpful response but also reduces the likelihood of hallucination.

However, even with these sophisticated techniques, there is always a risk of hallucination, indicating the continued need for rigorous output review and moderation.

## AI Safety Module: A Proposal
A proposed solution to enhance AI safety is the integration of an AI Safety Module in the overall application architecture. This module could work in tandem with LLMs, screening and filtering the outputs before they reach the end-user. It would utilize algorithms designed to flag potentially harmful, inaccurate, or inappropriate content, ensuring that the generated responses meet the necessary safety and accuracy standards.

## Suitable Content Filter Systems
Several existing content filter systems can be leveraged for this purpose. OpenAI has its own moderation API, which can be used to add a moderation layer to the outputs of the ChatGPT model. However, businesses seeking open-source solutions can consider tools like the Perspective API, developed by Jigsaw, a unit within Google. This tool uses machine learning to spot abuse and harassment online and could be adapted to screen LLM outputs.

Another way might be to let a human curate each question that is inputed or outputed to the LLM

## Conclusion
Large Language Models offer immense potential for enhancing customer service among other applications. But like all powerful tools, they need to be handled with care. As we navigate this new landscape, it's vital that we remain vigilant about potential risks and proactive in implementing safety measures. By integrating internal data, developing robust AI Safety Modules, and leveraging existing content filter systems, we can harness the power of LLMs while ensuring the safety and accuracy of their outputs.
