Reddit, known as the "front page of the internet," is a goldmine for driving traffic to websites, blogs, and online platforms. Recognizing this potential, I've developed a specialized Reddit Comment Bot designed to boost traffic on my latest project effectively.

## Key Features
* Automated Commenting: The bot intelligently comments on relevant posts, engaging with predefined Reddit communities
* Keyword Targeting: The bot only comments on certain threads or comments that have a high upvote ratio
* Safety: The bot does not spam reddit, but continuously comments on answers
* Answers: All answers are generated with AI and provide value. Also some answers have a link to my product inside to drive traffic.
* Execution: The bot scans for new posts matching my criteria and posts engaging comments.
* Monitoring: Track the bot's performance with detailed analytics and engagement on the comments

## Let's start
I am coding the bot in a language that I know and understand, which is PHP. The bot continuously monitors reddit comments and pick the comments that have the highest upvotes. Then my bot reads the post and drafts an answer to this post with my hidden marketing message.
